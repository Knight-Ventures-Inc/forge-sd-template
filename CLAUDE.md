## Commands

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm start        # Start production server
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript validation
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm test:run     # Run tests
pnpm build        # Verify production build
```

### Verification Sequence (Sacred Four)
```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test:run && pnpm build
```

### Database
```bash
pnpm db:generate  # Generate migrations
pnpm db:migrate   # Apply migrations
pnpm db:seed      # Seed development data
```

## Authority & Boundaries

### Human Lead
**[Name]** — Final decision-maker. Greenlights phases, reviews PRs, merges code, resolves disputes.

### Agent Roles
| Role | Agent | Authority |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Strategist | [e.g., Jordan/ChatGPT] | Business strategy, feature ideation |
| Spec Author | [e.g., CP/Claude Project] | Constitutional documents, prompts |
| Quality Gate | [e.g., CC/Claude Code] | Verification, PRs, build-plan |
| Implementation | [e.g., Cursor] | Code per task briefs |

### Key Boundaries
- **Constitutional docs are read-only during Execute** — Suggest changes, don't modify
- **Quality Gate owns build-plan.md** — No one else updates status
- **Implementation Engine output requires verification** — Never trust without checking

---

## Current State

### Phase
[Frame | Orchestrate | Refine | Govern | Execute]

### If in Execute
- **Current PR:** [PR-XX]
- **Build Plan:** `docs/build-plan.md`
- **Active Brief:** `ai_prompts/active/[current-brief].md`
- **Ops State:** `docs/ops/state.md`

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Verification sequence runs before every PR** — No exceptions
2. **Constitutional docs are authoritative** — When in doubt, check the spec
3. **Small fixes (<5 lines) are okay; large fixes go back** — The 5-line rule
4. **File-based handoffs** — Everything through `ai_prompts/`, not conversation
5. **Archive before starting** — Each PR archives the previous brief first

---

## Getting Oriented (New Session)

```
1. Read this file (you're doing it)
2. Check docs/ops/state.md for operational status
3. Check docs/build-plan.md for PR sequence
4. Run: git log --oneline -5
5. Check ai_prompts/active/ for current brief
6. Ready to proceed (~90 seconds total)
```
